Analysis on Testing:

 1. Validation data:
           a.BMI and realaed scientific parameter like BMI Categgory, 
		   Health Risk can only discussed for valid input data mean height and weight shall not be non positive.
 2. Program Behavior:
          a.may fail when available resource can not allocate enough bits of memory. 
		  Since height and weight are small practicle numbers occurance of this type of error is not possible.
		  b.Logical implementation needs to be tested with edge blocking test cases.
