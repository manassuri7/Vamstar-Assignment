Implementation analysis:

As per problem statement, it is given array of objects where computation done for each object based on its
properties values and results will be added to same object. 


What all needed:
  1.In my aproach I am using call() function which makes Method native to an object,
     so for each object a custom method can be used multiple times
  2. A function(Method of an object) to calculate BMI and categorize
      BMI and Health risk and add them as data members.
